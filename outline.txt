Crypted Coders (working name)

Idea: open source blockchain coding community where nft holders are able to contribute to future development and additions with funds being redistributed throughout the community, the more developers and marketing, the more we all make. Community driven coders focused on developing the next internet together. 

Goal: develop the new internet together through group driven projects. Marketing, sales, coding, and more welcome. 

Target audience: looking for those who can contribute to and add on to existing and future projects whether that be through coding, sales, marketing, ideas, housekeeping items, assistant work, managing discord, etc
